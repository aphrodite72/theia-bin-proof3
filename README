* diagnoser.exe

packer_redacted.exe and diagnoser_redacted.exe is attached to this repository for proofing. Code section is redacted intentionally. After buying, you should receive an complete copy of UPX-packed original executable and UPX-unpacked version as well.

This product is also used in The Finals, EA Anti-Cheat and the FACEIT Client (and more). These resources would be very helpful for understanding the capabilities of this packer, and you could also reverse engineer packer.exe for a decryptor.
